## Project Overview

> In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The application had an incomplete test suite. That's where I came in.

### Implemented Tests

| Test       		    | Implementation    |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| RSS Feeds             | are defined |
| RSS Feeds   	        | have URL (not empty, string type) |
| RSS Feeds          	| have name (not empty, string type) |
| The menu              | is hidden by default |
| The menu	            | changes visibility on click |
| Initial Entries		| is at least one entry in the initial feed |
| New Feed Selection	| has new content when a new feed is loaded |
